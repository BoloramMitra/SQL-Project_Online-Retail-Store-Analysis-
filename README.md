Online Retail Store Analysis

This is a SQL research project, where we will complete our project in 4 steps . 
We start by searching for suitable datasets from various sources to support our research goals. 
Once we have the datasets, we create our own problem statement to focus our investigation. 
We clean and modify the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data properly. 
We use MySQL as our main tool to analyze the data. Through SQL queries, we uncover important insights, patterns, and trends in the datasets. 
This project combines data collection, problem formulation, data preprocessing, and SQL-based analysis to make informed decisions and achieve actionable results in our research area.
